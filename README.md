`frontroute` is a front-end router library for single-page applications (SPA) built with [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/), with an API inspired by [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/).

`frontroute` is primarily designed for use with [raquo/Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar), 
but it doesn't have Laminar as a dependency and should fit nicely with any Scala.js library.

Built on top of:

* [raquo/Airstream](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream) 
* [tulz-app/tuplez](https://github.com/tulz-app/tuplez)
